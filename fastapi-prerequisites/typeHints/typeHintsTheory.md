**Type hints** in Python are a way to specify the expected data types of variables, function arguments, and return values in your code. They provide a form of static typing and help improve code readability and maintainability. While Python is a dynamically typed language, type hints don't enforce types at runtime; instead, they serve as documentation for developers and can be used by static analysis tools and linters.

Type hints were introduced in **Python 3.5** and are defined using the **typing** module, which provides a set of classes and functions for working with types.

There different types of type hints

## Basic Type Hints:
int, float, str, bool: These represent basic data types.

## Lists and Dictionaries:
List, Tuple, Dict, Set: These represent data structures.

## Custom Classes:
You can annotate your custom classes.

## Optional Values:
Use **Optional** to indicate a value may be None.

## Union Types:
Use **Union** to specify multiple possible types for a variable.

## Callable Types:
You can annotate **functions as arguments or return values.**


Type hints improve code quality and help catch type-related errors during development, making your code more robust and easier to understand. While Python doesn't enforce these hints at runtime, various tools like **mypy** can check your code for type correctness based on these hints.
