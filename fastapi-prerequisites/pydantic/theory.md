Pydantic simplifies the process of defining and working with structured data in Python by enforcing type hints and validation rules, which can help improve code correctness and maintainability.
Useful for working with complex data structures such as JSON, user input, or configuration files. It simplifies data validation, parsing, and serialization by allowing you to define Python data classes with type hints and validation rules.

## Use Cases:

### API Request Parsing: 
Pydantic can be used to validate and parse JSON data received from API requests.

### Form Data Handling: 
When building web applications, you can use Pydantic to validate and handle user-submitted form data.

### Configuration Parsing: 
Parse and validate configuration files or environment variables in a structured way.

### Data Cleaning and Transformation: 
Convert and validate data from one format to another, such as CSV to JSON.

### Database Models: 
Use Pydantic models to validate and sanitize data before storing it in a database.

### Automatic Documentation Generation: 
Pydantic can generate documentation for your data models, making it easier for others to understand how to interact with your code.
